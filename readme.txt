== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=== There is a feature that I want... ===

If you would like a new feature, or something doesn't work the way it should, do not hesitate to contact me

=== I have a URL that starts with WebCal ===

If you have a URL that starts with `webcal`, then all you have to do is change the `webcal://` to `http://` or (better) `https://` and that should work.

=== How often is the calendar checked for new events? ===

The calendar is checked on the fly.

=== Why aren't my events showing up correctly? ===

This plugin makes an attempt to support as many event definitions that follow the ICS specification (RFC 2445) as possible. However, there may be bugs in how the plugin interprets the parsed data.

If an event is showing up correctly in your calendar application (iCal, Google Calendar) but not on your blog, please contact me.
